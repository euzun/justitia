# Justitia

A Python implementation of Justitia: Cryptographic key derivation from biometric inferences for remote authentication.

## Overview

Justitia provides cryptographic key derivation and fuzzy extractor functions optimized for biometric data. It includes the generation of Locality Sensitive Hash (LSH) for feature arrays, as well as error-tolerant key generation from biometric inferences using secure masking techniques.

### Reference

If you use Justitia in your research, please cite the following paper:

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need to have Python 3.8+ installed.

### Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

```plaintext
fastpbkdf2==0.2.0
numpy==1.22.4
scikit-learn==1.0.2
scipy==1.8.1
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/euzun/justitia.git
cd justitia
```
2. **Install dependencies:**
To set up the environment and install all necessary packages, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installing Specific Requirements

* `fastpbkdf2` is used for fast PBKDF2-HMAC key derivation.
* `numpy` and `scipy` are used for array manipulation, random sampling, and statistical analysis.
* `scikit-learn` is required for normalization operations on hyperplanes in LSH generation.

## Usage

Once installed, you can use Justitia by executing the main Python script with the required arguments:

```bash
python justitia.py EMB_DIR ENR_ID QUE_ID LSH_BIT_LEN MASK_PROB NROF_SUB_BITS FE_ERR_THR
```

Where:

* `EMB_DIR:` Path to the embeddings directory.
* `ENR_ID:` Index of the enrollment person (embedding label).
* `QUE_ID:` Index of the query person (embedding label).
* `LSH_BIT_LEN:` Length of LSH in bits.
* `MASK_PROB:` Noise cancellation masking probability.
* `NROF_SUB_BITS:` Number of bits subsampled in the fuzzy extractor.
* `FE_ERR_THR:` Number of error bits the fuzzy extractor can tolerate.

## Example
```bash
python justitia.py /path/to/embeddings 1 2 128 0.1 8 2
```

This command will run the biometric key derivation for the enrollment ID 1 and query ID 2 using embeddings located in `/path/to/embeddings`, with the specified parameters for LSH bit length, masking probability, number of bits for subsampling, and fuzzy extractor error threshold.
