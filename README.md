# Justitia

A Python implementation of Justitia: Cryptographic key derivation from biometric inferences for remote authentication.

## Overview

Justitia provides cryptographic key derivation from biometric data, enabling the secure locking and unlocking of a chosen secret (e.g., the private key of a (public, private) key pair) while storing it in a remote database without revealing any biometric data to third parties. Justitia combines the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models in biometric verification with zero-knowledge-proof (ZKP)-based cryptographic schemes. It introduces sophisticated techniques to transform the fuzzy domain of DL embeddings into a cryptographically compatible Hamming space, using powerful noise-suppressing methods. Please refer our paper for more details.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need to have Python 3.8+ installed.

### Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file:

```plaintext
fastpbkdf2==0.2.0
numpy==1.22.4
scikit-learn==1.0.2
scipy==1.8.1
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/euzun/justitia.git
cd justitia
```
2. **Install dependencies:**
To set up the environment and install all necessary packages, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installing Specific Requirements

* `fastpbkdf2` is used for fast PBKDF2-HMAC key derivation.
* `numpy` and `scipy` are used for array manipulation, random sampling, and statistical analysis.
* `scikit-learn` is required for normalization operations on hyperplanes in LSH generation.

## Usage

Once installed, you can use Justitia by executing the main Python script with the required arguments:

```bash
python justitia.py EMB_DIR ENR_ID QUE_ID LSH_BIT_LEN MASK_PROB NROF_SUB_BITS FE_ERR_THR
```

Where:

* `EMB_DIR:` Path to the embeddings directory. An embedding array source, extracted with FaceNet, is included in the repo (`lfw_clean_embeddings.p` belongs to 50 people from `Labeled Faces in the Wild` dataset).
* `ENR_ID:` Index of the enrollment person (embedding label).
* `QUE_ID:` Index of the query person (embedding label).
* `LSH_BIT_LEN:` Length of LSH in bits.
* `MASK_PROB:` Noise cancellation masking probability.
* `NROF_SUB_BITS:` Number of bits subsampled in the fuzzy extractor.
* `FE_ERR_THR:` Number of error bits the fuzzy extractor can tolerate.

## Example

1. **Same person's biometrics on enrollment and recovery.**

```bash
python justitia.py lfw_clean_embeddings.p 5 5 128 0.7 64 9
```

Which outputs:

```bash
True Positive. secret: [27c5e300ff9a927b3aef3730c72b39ac] is locked with enrollment_id:5. recoveredSecret: [27c5e300ff9a927b3aef3730c72b39ac] is recovered with query_id: 5
```

2. **Different peoples's biometrics on enrollment (id 1) and recovery (id 2).**
```bash
python justitia.py lfw_clean_embeddings.p 1 2 128 0.7 64 9
```

Which outputs:

```bash
True Negative. secret: [082bfb35d04d81b89df889306866262f] is locked with enrollment_id:1. recoveredSecret: [None] is recovered with query_id: 2
```
