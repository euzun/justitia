# Justitia

A Python implementation of Justitia: Cryptographic key derivation from biometric inferences for remote authentication.

## Overview

Justitia provides cryptographic key derivation and fuzzy extractor functions optimized for biometric data. It includes the generation of Locality Sensitive Hash (LSH) for feature arrays, as well as error-tolerant key generation from biometric inferences using secure masking techniques.
